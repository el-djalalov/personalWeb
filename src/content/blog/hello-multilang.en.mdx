Hello and welcome! I'm excited to announce that my blog now supports multiple languages.

## Available Languages

You can now read my blog posts in:

- **English** - The default language
- **O'zbekcha** - Uzbek
- **Русский** - Russian

## How It Works

Look for the language switcher at the top of each post. If a translation is available, you'll see buttons to switch between languages.

Not all posts will have translations immediately, but I'll be adding them over time. Stay tuned for more content in your preferred language!

## Why Multilingual?

As a developer from Uzbekistan, I want to share my knowledge with a broader audience, including those who prefer reading in their native language.

Thank you for reading!
